# AppBaoThuc preview 1.0
## Change log 1.0
### New features:
  There are no new features in this release. But from alpha phase to preview phase is a big change from the system perspective. We were wrapping up everything to provide the acceptable user experience and a stable application. All that are remaining is providing any new challenges, and new features that might make better user experiences. So, there are still stuff to do.
### On progess features:
  1. Prevent phone screen to turn off when there is a happening alarm.
  2. Provide a kind of folder picker which allows the user to choose which folders the app should look for music when choosing ringtones.
  3. Provide actual using of speaker when headsets are plugged. The current behavior is using a trick to make phone routes its ringtone to outer speaker, so the experience is pretty weird.

  2. Bug music in alpha v0.0.4
